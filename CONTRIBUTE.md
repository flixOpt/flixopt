### Working with Documentation

## Code Quality Standards

### Automated Checks
We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting. After the one-time setup above, **code quality checks run automatically on every commit**.

### Manual Checks
To run checks manually:
- `ruff check --fix .` - Check and fix linting issues
- `ruff format .` - Format code
- `pre-commit run --all-files` - Run all pre-commit checks

### Testing
- `pytest` - Run the test suite
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR

### Coding Guidelines
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Write clear, self-documenting code with helpful comments
- Include type hints for function signatures
- Create or update tests for new functionality
- Aim for 100% test coverage for new code

## Workflow

### Branches & Pull Requests
1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with clear messages

3. Push your branch and open a Pull Request

4. Ensure all CI checks pass

### Branch Naming
- Features: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`
- Documentation: `docs/what-changed`

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters

## Releases

We follow **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Releases are created manually from the `main` branch by maintainers.
