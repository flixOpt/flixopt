## [Unreleased] - ????-??-??
This release brings multi-year investments and stochastic modeling to flixopt.
Furthermore, I/O methods were improved, and resampling and selection of parts of the FlowSystem are now possible.
Several internal improvements were made to the codebase.

### ‚ú® Added

**Multi-year investments:**
A flixopt model might be modeled with a "year" dimension.
This enables modeling transformation pathways over multiple years with several investment decisions

**Stochastic modeling:**
A flixopt model can be modeled with a scenario dimension.
Scenarios can be weighted and variables can be equated across scenarios. This enables modeling uncertainties in the flow system, such as:
* Different demand profiles
* Different price forecasts
* Different weather conditions

Common use cases are:
* Find the best overall investment decision for possible scenarios (robust decision-making)
* Find the best dispatch for the most important assets under uncertain price and weather conditions

The weighted sum of the total objective effect of each scenario is used as the objective of the optimization.

**Improved Data handling: I/O, resampling and more through xarray:**
* IO for all Interfaces and the FlowSystem with round-trip serialization support
    * NetCDF export/import capabilities for all Interface objects and FlowSystem
    * JSON export for documentation purposes
    * Recursive handling of nested Interface objects
* FlowSystem data manipulation methods
   * `sel()` and `isel()` methods for temporal data selection
   * `resample()` method for temporal resampling
   * `copy()` method to create a copy of a FlowSystem, including all underlying Elements and their data
   * `__eq__()` method for FlowSystem comparison
* Core data handling improvements
   * `get_dataarray_stats()` function for statistical summaries
   * Enhanced `DataConverter` class with better TimeSeriesData support

**Other additions:**
* FlowSystem restoring: The used FlowSystem is now accessible directly from the results without manual restoring (lazily). All parameters can be safely accessed anytime after the solve.
* FlowResults added as a new class to store the results of Flows. They can now be accessed directly.
* Added precomputed DataArrays for `size`s, `flow_rate`s and `flow_hour`s.
* Added `effects_per_component()`-Dataset to Results that stores the direct (and indirect) effects of each component. This greatly improves the evaluation of the impact of individual Components, even with many and complex effects.
* Improved filter methods in `results.py`
* Balanced storage - Storage charging and discharging sizes can now be forced to be equal when optimizing their size by the `balanced` parameter.
* Added Example for 2-stage Investment decisions leveraging the resampling of a FlowSystem
* New Storage Parameter: `relative_minimum_final_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_final_charge_state` parameter for final state control. Default to last value of `relative_minimum_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_charge_state`, which will prevent change of behaviour for most users.

### üí• Breaking Changes
* `relative_minimum_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_charge_state` don't have an extra timestep anymore.
* Renamed class `SystemModel` to `FlowSystemModel`
* Renamed class `Model` to `Submodel`
* Renamed `mode` parameter in plotting methods to `style`

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed
* FlowSystems cannot be shared across multiple Calculations anymore. A copy of the FlowSystem is created instead, making every Calculation independent
* Each Subcalculation in `SegmentedCalculation` now has its own distinct `FlowSystem` object
* Type system overhaul - added clear separation between temporal and non-temporal data throughout codebase for better clarity
* Enhanced FlowSystem interface with improved `__repr__()` and `__str__()` methods
* Improved Model Structure - Views and organisation is now divided into:
  * Model: The main Model (linopy.Model) that is used to create and store the variables and constraints for the flow_system.
  * Submodel: The base class for all submodels. Each is a subset of the Model, for simpler access and clearer code.

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecated
* The `agg_group` and `agg_weight` parameters of `TimeSeriesData` are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use `aggregation_group` and `aggregation_weight` instead.
* The `active_timesteps` parameter of `Calculation` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the new `sel(time=...)` method on the FlowSystem instead.
* The assignment of Bus Objects to Flow.bus is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the label of the Bus instead.
* The usage of Effects objects in Dicts to assign shares to Effects is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the label of the Effect instead.


### üêõ Fixed
* Enhanced NetCDF I/O with proper attribute preservation for DataArrays
* Improved error handling and validation in serialization processes
* Better type consistency across all framework components

### üöß Known Issues
* IO for single Interfaces/Elements to Datasets might not work properly if the Interface/Element is not part of a fully transformed and connected FlowSystem. This arises from Numeric Data not being stored as xr.DataArray by the user. To avoid this, always use the `to_dataset()` on Elements inside a FlowSystem that's connected and transformed.

### üë∑ Development
* **BREAKING**: Calculation.do_modeling() now returns the Calculation object instead of its linopy.Model
* FlowSystem data management simplified - removed `time_series_collection` pattern in favor of direct timestep properties
* Change modeling hierarchy to allow for more flexibility in future development. This leads to minimal changes in the access and creation of Submodels and their variables.
* Added new module `.modeling`that contains Modelling primitives and utilities
* Clearer separation between the main Model and "Submodels"
* Improved access to the Submodels and their variables, constraints and submodels
* Added `__repr__()` for Submodels to easily inspect its content
* Enhanced data handling methods
   * `fit_to_model_coords()` method for data alignment
   * `fit_effects_to_model_coords()` method for effect data processing
   * `connect_and_transform()` method replacing several operations

  - *Note: This is still experimental and might change in the future*

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed
- **Multi-Flow Support**: `Sink`, `Source`, and `SourceAndSink` now accept multiple `flows` as `inputs` and `outputs` instead of just one. This enables modeling more use cases with these classes
- **Flow Control**: Both `Sink` and `Source` now have a `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates` argument to prevent simultaneous flow rates of more than one of their flows

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecated
- For the classes `Sink`, `Source` and `SourceAndSink`: `.sink`, `.source` and `.prevent_simultaneous_sink_and_source` are deprecated in favor of the new arguments `inputs`, `outputs` and `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates`

### üêõ Fixed

---

## [2.1.5] - 2025-07-08

---

## [2.1.3] - 2025-07-08

### üêõ Fixed

---

## [2.1.2] - 2025-06-14

### üêõ Fixed
- Storage losses per hour were not calculated correctly, as mentioned by @brokenwings01. This might have led to issues when modeling large losses and long timesteps.
  - Old implementation:     $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) \cdot \Delta \text{t}_{i}$
  - Correct implementation: $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) ^{\Delta \text{t}_{i}}$

### üöß Known Issues
- Just to mention: Plotly >= 6 may raise errors if "nbformat" is not installed. We pinned plotly to <6, but this may be fixed in the future.
