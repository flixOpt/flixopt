## [Unreleased] - ????-??-??
This release introduces new model dimensions (periods and scenarios) for multi-period investments and stochastic modeling, along with a redesigned effect sharing system and enhanced I/O capabilities.

### ‚ú® Added

**New model dimensions:**
* **Period dimension**: Enables multi-period investment modeling with distinct decisions in each period for transformation pathway optimization
* **Scenario dimension**: Supports stochastic modeling with weighted scenarios for robust decision-making under uncertainty (demand, prices, weather)

**Redesigned effect sharing system:**
Effects now use intuitive `share_from_*` syntax that clearly shows contribution sources:
```python
costs = fx.Effect('costs', '‚Ç¨', 'Total costs',
    share_from_temporal={'CO2': 0.2},      # From temporal effects
    share_from_periodic={'land': 100})     # From periodic effects
```
This replaces `specific_share_to_other_effects_*` parameters and inverts the direction for clearer relationships.

**Enhanced I/O and data handling:**
* NetCDF/JSON serialization for all Interface objects and FlowSystem with round-trip support
* FlowSystem manipulation: `sel()`, `isel()`, `resample()`, `copy()`, `__eq__()` methods
* Direct access to FlowSystem from results without manual restoring (lazily loaded)
* New `FlowResults` class and precomputed DataArrays for sizes/flow_rates/flow_hours
* `effects_per_component()` dataset for component impact evaluation, including all indirect effects through effect shares

**Other additions:**
* Balanced storage - charging and discharging sizes can be forced equal via `balanced` parameter
* New Storage parameters: `relative_minimum_final_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_final_charge_state` for final state control
* Improved filter methods in results
* Example for 2-stage investment decisions leveraging FlowSystem resampling

### üí• Breaking Changes
* `relative_minimum_charge_state` and `relative_maximum_charge_state` don't have an extra timestep anymore.
* Renamed class `SystemModel` to `FlowSystemModel`
* Renamed class `Model` to `Submodel`
* Renamed `mode` parameter in plotting methods to `style`
* `Calculation.do_modeling()` now returns the `Calculation` object instead of its `linopy.Model`. Callers that previously accessed the linopy model directly should now use `calculation.do_modeling().model` instead of `calculation.do_modeling()`.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed
* FlowSystems cannot be shared across multiple Calculations anymore. A copy of the FlowSystem is created instead, making every Calculation independent
* Each Subcalculation in `SegmentedCalculation` now has its own distinct `FlowSystem` object
* Type system overhaul - added clear separation between temporal and non-temporal data throughout codebase for better clarity
* Enhanced FlowSystem interface with improved `__repr__()` and `__str__()` methods
* Improved Model Structure - Views and organisation is now divided into:
  * Model: The main Model (linopy.Model) that is used to create and store the variables and constraints for the flow_system.
  * Submodel: The base class for all submodels. Each is a subset of the Model, for simpler access and clearer code.

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecated
* The `agg_group` and `agg_weight` parameters of `TimeSeriesData` are deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use `aggregation_group` and `aggregation_weight` instead.
* The `active_timesteps` parameter of `Calculation` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the new `sel(time=...)` method on the FlowSystem instead.
* The assignment of Bus Objects to Flow.bus is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the label of the Bus instead.
* The usage of Effects objects in Dicts to assign shares to Effects is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use the label of the Effect instead.
* Effect parameters renamed:
  - `minimum_investment` ‚Üí `minimum_periodic`
  - `maximum_investment` ‚Üí `maximum_periodic`
  - `minimum_operation` ‚Üí `minimum_temporal`
  - `maximum_operation` ‚Üí `maximum_temporal`
  - `minimum_operation_per_hour` ‚Üí `minimum_per_hour`
  - `maximum_operation_per_hour` ‚Üí `maximum_per_hour`

### üî• Removed
* **Effect share parameters**: The old `specific_share_to_other_effects_*` parameters were replaced WITHOUT DEPRECATION
  - `specific_share_to_other_effects_operation` ‚Üí `share_from_temporal` (with inverted direction)
  - `specific_share_to_other_effects_invest` ‚Üí `share_from_periodic` (with inverted direction)

### üêõ Fixed
* Enhanced NetCDF I/O with proper attribute preservation for DataArrays
* Improved error handling and validation in serialization processes
* Better type consistency across all framework components

### üöß Known Issues
* IO for single Interfaces/Elements to Datasets might not work properly if the Interface/Element is not part of a fully transformed and connected FlowSystem. This arises from Numeric Data not being stored as xr.DataArray by the user. To avoid this, always use the `to_dataset()` on Elements inside a FlowSystem that's connected and transformed.

### üë∑ Development
* FlowSystem data management simplified - removed `time_series_collection` pattern in favor of direct timestep properties
* Change modeling hierarchy to allow for more flexibility in future development. This leads to minimal changes in the access and creation of Submodels and their variables.
* Added new module `.modeling` that contains Modelling primitives and utilities
* Clearer separation between the main Model and "Submodels"
* Improved access to the Submodels and their variables, constraints and submodels
* Added `__repr__()` for Submodels to easily inspect its content
* Enhanced data handling methods
   * `fit_to_model_coords()` method for data alignment
   * `fit_effects_to_model_coords()` method for effect data processing
   * `connect_and_transform()` method replacing several operations

  - *Note: This is still experimental and might change in the future*

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed
- **Multi-Flow Support**: `Sink`, `Source`, and `SourceAndSink` now accept multiple `flows` as `inputs` and `outputs` instead of just one. This enables modeling more use cases with these classes
- **Flow Control**: Both `Sink` and `Source` now have a `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates` argument to prevent simultaneous flow rates of more than one of their flows

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecated
- For the classes `Sink`, `Source` and `SourceAndSink`: `.sink`, `.source` and `.prevent_simultaneous_sink_and_source` are deprecated in favor of the new arguments `inputs`, `outputs` and `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates`

### üêõ Fixed
- Fixed testing issue with new `linopy` version 0.5.6

### üë∑ Development

---

## [2.1.5] - 2025-07-08

---

## [2.1.4] - 2025-07-08

### üêõ Fixed

---

## [2.1.3] - 2025-07-08

### üêõ Fixed
- Using `Effect.maximum_operation_per_hour` raised an error, needing an extra timestep. This has been fixed thanks to @PRse4.

---

## [2.1.2] - 2025-06-14

### üêõ Fixed
- Storage losses per hour were not calculated correctly, as mentioned by @brokenwings01. This might have led to issues when modeling large losses and long timesteps.
  - Old implementation:     $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) \cdot \Delta \text{t}_{i}$
  - Correct implementation: $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) ^{\Delta \text{t}_{i}}$

### üöß Known Issues
- Just to mention: Plotly >= 6 may raise errors if "nbformat" is not installed. We pinned plotly to <6, but this may be fixed in the future.
