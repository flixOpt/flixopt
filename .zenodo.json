  "description": "Vector based energy and material flow optimization framework in Python. FlixOpt is a framework for modeling and optimizing energy and material flow systems - from district heating networks to industrial production lines, from renewable energy portfolios to supply chain logistics. Built on linopy and xarray, it provides a progressive enhancement approach that allows users to start with simple models and incrementally add complexity such as multi-period investments, stochastic scenarios, and custom constraints.",
