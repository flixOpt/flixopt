# Roadmap and Vision

## üéØ Our Vision

**FlixOpt aims to be the most accessible, flexible, and universal Python framework for energy and material flow optimization.**

We believe optimization modeling should be **approachable for beginners** yet **powerful for experts**, minimizing context switching between **short-term dispatch** and **long-term investment** planning.

## üöÄ Short-term (Next 6 months)

- **Stochastic/multi-period examples** - Showcase v3.0 capabilities with comprehensive examples
- **Advanced result analysis** - Automated reporting, enhanced visualizations, cost breakdowns ([#398](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/issues/398))
- **Interactive tutorials** - Browser-based learning without installation ([#304](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/issues/304))

## üîÆ Medium-term (6-12 months)

- **Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA)** - Explore near-optimal solutions for robust decision-making ([#338](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/issues/338), [PyPSA](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/optimization/modelling-to-generate-alternatives/), [Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/modes/))
- **Advanced stochastic optimization** - Two-stage programming, CVaR, rolling horizon ([PyPSA reference](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/optimization/stochastic/))
- **Enhanced component library** - Sector coupling, hydrogen systems, thermal networks, demand-side management

## üåü Long-term (18+ months)

- **Universal applicability showcase** - Examples and components for supply chains, water networks, production planning
- **Production-ready features** - API interfaces, distributed solving, real-time optimization ([#402](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/issues/402))
- **Community ecosystem** - Component registry, plugin system, template library

## üìÖ Release Philosophy

FlixOpt follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **Major** (v3‚Üív4): Breaking changes, major features
- **Minor** (v3.0‚Üív3.1): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (v3.0.0‚Üív3.0.1): Bug fixes only

Target: Patch releases as needed, minor releases every 2-3 months.
