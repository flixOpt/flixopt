# Roadmap and Vision

## üéØ Our Vision

**FlixOpt aims to be the most accessible, flexible, and universal Python framework for energy and material flow optimization.**

We believe that optimization modeling should be **approachable for beginners** yet **powerful for experts**. We also believe in **minimizing context switching** - use the same tool for short-term operational planning and long-term investment analysis.

### Core Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with simple models and add complexity incrementally without refactoring
2. **Universal Applicability**: One framework for energy, materials, logistics, and integrated systems
3. **Transparency**: Full access to model structure - no black boxes
4. **Reproducibility**: Self-contained results with complete model information
5. **Modern Foundations**: Built on state-of-the-art tools (linopy, xarray)

## üöÄ Short-term Goals

### Enhanced Component Library

**Goal**: Expand pre-built, domain-specific components to cover more real-world use cases.

**Planned Components**:
- **Sector coupling**: Power-to-gas, power-to-heat, vehicle-to-grid
- **Hydrogen systems**: Electrolyzers, fuel cells, hydrogen storage
- **Thermal networks**: District heating/cooling with temperature levels
- **Demand-side management**: Flexible loads, demand response

**Status**: üü° In planning - contributions welcome!

### Examples of Stochastic and Multi-Period Modeling

**Goal**: Comprehensive showcase examples demonstrating the new multi-dimensional modeling capabilities introduced in v3.0.

**Planned Examples**:
- Multi-period investment planning with technology evolution
- Stochastic optimization under demand uncertainty
- Combined multi-period + stochastic scenarios
- Two-stage decision making (investment vs. operation)

**Status**: üü° In development - basic examples exist, need comprehensive showcase

### Advanced Result Analysis

**Goal**: Make it easier to understand and communicate optimization results.

**Planned Features**:
- Automated report generation (HTML, PDF)
- Enhanced built-in visualizations
- Cost breakdown analysis tools
- Sensitivity analysis helpers
- Interactive dashboards

**Status**: üü° In planning

### Interactive Tutorials

**Goal**: Browser-based, reactive tutorials for learning FlixOpt without local installation.

**Planned Features**:
- JupyterLite-based tutorials
- Step-by-step interactive examples
- Instant feedback without setup
- Progressive learning path

**Status**: üî¥ Not started - waiting for infrastructure decisions

---

## üîÆ Medium-term Vision

### Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA)

**Goal**: Built-in support for exploring near-optimal solution spaces to produce more robust, diverse solutions under uncertainty.

**Why MGA?**
Traditional optimization finds a single optimal solution. MGA finds multiple near-optimal alternatives that perform similarly but use different technologies or strategies. This is crucial for:
- Robust decision-making under uncertainty
- Exploring diverse technology pathways
- Stakeholder engagement with multiple options
- Avoiding over-optimization to fragile solutions

**Reference Implementations**:
- [PyPSA MGA](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/optimization/modelling-to-generate-alternatives/)
- [Calliope Modes](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/modes/)

**Status**: üü° Research phase - exploring implementation approaches

### Advanced Stochastic Optimization

**Goal**: Sophisticated `Calculation` classes for different stochastic optimization paradigms.

**Planned Approaches**:
- **Two-stage stochastic programming**: Investment decisions (here-and-now) vs. operational decisions (wait-and-see)
- **Risk preferences with CVaR**: Optimize for risk-averse or risk-neutral strategies
- **Rolling horizon with forecast updates**: Progressive uncertainty resolution
- **Chance constraints**: Probabilistic constraints with confidence levels

**Reference**: [PyPSA Stochastic Optimization](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/optimization/stochastic/)

**Status**: üü° Design phase - basic scenario support exists in v3.0

### Standardized Cost Calculations

**Goal**: Align with industry standards for financial analysis.

**Planned Features**:
- VDI 2067 compliance for CAPEX/OPEX calculations
- Built-in annuity calculations
- NPV and IRR analysis
- Subsidy and incentive modeling

**Status**: üî¥ Not started

## üåü Long-term Vision

### Showcase Universal Applicability

**Goal**: Demonstrate that FlixOpt handles any flow-based system, not just energy.

**Challenges**:
FlixOpt already has the technical capability to model supply chains, water networks, production planning, and chemical processes. The barrier is examples and domain-specific component libraries.

**Needed**:
- **Example gallery**: Working models from different domains
- **Domain-specific components**: Pre-built abstractions for common patterns in each field
- **Case studies**: Real-world applications with documentation
- **Domain tutorials**: Onboarding guides for non-energy users

**Status**: üî¥ Limited examples - mostly energy systems

### Production-Ready Features

**Goal**: First-class support for deploying FlixOpt models in production environments.

**Planned Features**:
- **API interfaces**: REST/GraphQL for model-as-a-service
- **Distributed solving**: Large-scale problems across compute clusters
- **Real-time updates**: Streaming data integration for rolling optimization
- **Monitoring and logging**: Production-grade observability
- **Containerization**: Docker images and Kubernetes deployments
- **Versioning**: Model versioning and experiment tracking

**Status**: üî¥ Research needed - current focus is research/engineering use

### Community Ecosystem

**Goal**: Rich library of user-contributed components, examples, and extensions.

**Vision**:
- **Component registry**: Searchable catalog of community components
- **Plugin system**: Easy-to-share extensions
- **Template library**: Starting points for common use cases
- **Integration packages**: Connectors to data sources, GIS, databases
- **Best practices**: Community-driven patterns and anti-patterns

**Status**: üü° Foundation exists - need community growth

## üìÖ Release Philosophy

FlixOpt follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major versions** (v3.0, v4.0): Breaking changes, major new features
- **Minor versions** (v3.1, v3.2): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch versions** (v3.0.1, v3.0.2): Bug fixes, no new features

We aim for:
- Regular patch releases for bug fixes
- Minor releases every 2-3 months with new features
- Major releases when significant architectural changes are needed
