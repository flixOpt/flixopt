# InvestParameters

[`InvestParameters`][flixopt.interface.InvestParameters] model investment decisions in optimization problems, enabling both binary (invest/don't invest) and continuous sizing choices with comprehensive cost modeling.

## Investment Decision Types

FlixOpt supports two main types of investment decisions:

### Binary Investment

Fixed-size investment creating a yes/no decision (e.g., install a 100 kW generator):

$$\label{eq:invest_binary}
v_\text{invest} = s_\text{invest} \cdot \text{size}_\text{fixed}
$$

With:
- $v_\text{invest}$ being the resulting investment size
- $s_\text{invest} \in \{0, 1\}$ being the binary investment decision
- $\text{size}_\text{fixed}$ being the predefined component size

**Behavior:**
- $s_\text{invest} = 0$: no investment ($v_\text{invest} = 0$)
- $s_\text{invest} = 1$: invest at fixed size ($v_\text{invest} = \text{size}_\text{fixed}$)

---

### Continuous Sizing

Variable-size investment with bounds (e.g., battery capacity from 10-1000 kWh):

$$\label{eq:invest_continuous}
s_\text{invest} \cdot \text{size}_\text{min} \leq v_\text{invest} \leq s_\text{invest} \cdot \text{size}_\text{max}
$$

With:
- $v_\text{invest}$ being the investment size variable (continuous)
- $s_\text{invest} \in \{0, 1\}$ being the binary investment decision
- $\text{size}_\text{min}$ being the minimum investment size (if investing)
- $\text{size}_\text{max}$ being the maximum investment size

**Behavior:**
- $s_\text{invest} = 0$: no investment ($v_\text{invest} = 0$)
- $s_\text{invest} = 1$: invest with size in $[\text{size}_\text{min}, \text{size}_\text{max}]$

This uses the **bounds with state** pattern described in [Bounds and States](../modeling-patterns/bounds-and-states.md#bounds-with-state).

---

### Optional vs. Mandatory Investment

The `optional` parameter controls whether investment is required:

**Optional Investment** (`optional=True`):
$$\label{eq:invest_optional}
s_\text{invest} \in \{0, 1\}
$$

The optimization can freely choose to invest or not.

**Mandatory Investment** (`optional=False`):
$$\label{eq:invest_mandatory}
s_\text{invest} = 1
$$

The investment must occur (useful for mandatory upgrades or replacements).

---

## Effect Modeling

Investment effects (costs, emissions, etc.) are modeled using three components:

### Fixed Effects

One-time effects incurred if investment is made, independent of size:

$$\label{eq:invest_fixed_effects}
E_{e,\text{fix}} = s_\text{invest} \cdot \text{fix}_e
$$

With:
- $E_{e,\text{fix}}$ being the fixed contribution to effect $e$
- $\text{fix}_e$ being the fixed effect value (e.g., fixed installation cost)

**Examples:**
- Fixed installation costs (permits, grid connection)
- One-time environmental impacts (land preparation)
- Fixed labor or administrative costs

---

### Specific Effects

Effects proportional to investment size (per-unit costs):

$$\label{eq:invest_specific_effects}
E_{e,\text{spec}} = v_\text{invest} \cdot \text{spec}_e
$$

With:
- $E_{e,\text{spec}}$ being the size-dependent contribution to effect $e$
- $\text{spec}_e$ being the specific effect value per unit size (e.g., €/kW)

**Examples:**
- Equipment costs (€/kW)
- Material requirements (kg steel/kW)
- Recurring costs (€/kW/year maintenance)

---

### Piecewise Effects

Non-linear effect relationships using piecewise linear approximations:

$$\label{eq:invest_piecewise_effects}
E_{e,\text{pw}} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \lambda_k \cdot r_{e,k}
$$

Subject to:
$$
v_\text{invest} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \lambda_k \cdot v_k
$$

With:
- $E_{e,\text{pw}}$ being the piecewise contribution to effect $e$
- $\lambda_k$ being the piecewise lambda variables (see [Piecewise](../features/Piecewise.md))
- $r_{e,k}$ being the effect rate at piece $k$
- $v_k$ being the size points defining the pieces

**Use cases:**
- Economies of scale (bulk discounts)
- Technology learning curves
- Threshold effects (capacity tiers with different costs)

See [Piecewise](../features/Piecewise.md) for detailed mathematical formulation.

---

### Divestment Effects

Costs incurred if investment is NOT made:

$$\label{eq:invest_divest_effects}
E_{e,\text{divest}} = (1 - s_\text{invest}) \cdot \text{divest}_e
$$

With:
- $E_{e,\text{divest}}$ being the divestment contribution to effect $e$
- $\text{divest}_e$ being the divestment effect value

**Behavior:**
- $s_\text{invest} = 0$: divestment effects are incurred
- $s_\text{invest} = 1$: no divestment effects

**Examples:**
- Demolition or disposal costs
- Contractual penalties for not investing
- Opportunity costs or lost revenues

---

### Total Investment Effects

The total contribution to effect $e$ from an investment is:

$$\label{eq:invest_total_effects}
E_{e,\text{invest}} = E_{e,\text{fix}} + E_{e,\text{spec}} + E_{e,\text{pw}} + E_{e,\text{divest}}
$$

Effects integrate into the overall system effects as described in [Effects, Penalty & Objective](../effects-penalty-objective.md).

---

## Integration with Components

Investment parameters modify component sizing:

### Without Investment
Component size is a fixed parameter:
$$
\text{size} = \text{size}_\text{nominal}
$$

### With Investment
Component size becomes a variable:
$$
\text{size} = v_\text{invest}
$$

This size variable then appears in component constraints. For example, flow rate bounds become:

$$
v_\text{invest} \cdot \text{rel}_\text{lower} \leq p(t) \leq v_\text{invest} \cdot \text{rel}_\text{upper}
$$

Using the **scaled bounds** pattern from [Bounds and States](../modeling-patterns/bounds-and-states.md#scaled-bounds).

---

## Cost Annualization

**Important:** All investment cost values must be properly weighted to match the optimization model's time horizon.

For long-term investments, costs should be annualized:

$$\label{eq:annualization}
\text{cost}_\text{annual} = \frac{\text{cost}_\text{capital} \cdot r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
$$

With:
- $\text{cost}_\text{capital}$ being the upfront investment cost
- $r$ being the discount rate
- $n$ being the equipment lifetime in years

**Example:** €1,000,000 equipment with 20-year life and 5% discount rate
$$
\text{cost}_\text{annual} = \frac{1{,}000{,}000 \cdot 0.05}{1 - (1.05)^{-20}} \approx €80{,}243/\text{year}
$$
