# Recipes

**Coming Soon!** 🚧

This section will contain quick, copy-paste ready code snippets for common FlixOpt patterns.

---

## What Will Be Here?

Short, focused code snippets showing **how to do specific things** in FlixOpt:

- Common modeling patterns
- Integration with other tools
- Performance optimizations
- Domain-specific solutions
- Data analysis shortcuts

Unlike full examples, recipes will be focused snippets showing a single concept.

---

## Planned Topics

- **Storage Patterns** - Batteries, thermal storage, seasonal storage
- **Multi-Criteria Optimization** - Balance multiple objectives
- **Data I/O** - Loading time series from CSV, databases, APIs
- **Data Manipulation** - Common xarray operations for parameterization and analysis
- **Investment Optimization** - Size optimization strategies
- **Renewable Integration** - Solar, wind capacity optimization
- **Status Constraints** - Minimum runtime, startup costs
- **Large-Scale Problems** - Segmented and aggregated calculations
- **Custom Constraints** - Extend models with linopy
- **Domain-Specific Patterns** - District heating, microgrids, industrial processes

## Want to Contribute?

**We need your help!** If you have recurring modeling patterns or clever solutions to share, please contribute via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/flixopt/flixopt/issues) or pull requests.

Guidelines:
1. Keep it short (< 100 lines of code)
2. Focus on one specific technique
3. Add brief explanation and when to use it

Check the [contribution guide](../../contribute.md) for details.
