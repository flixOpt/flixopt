# flixopt: Energy and Material Flow Optimization Framework

**flixopt** is a Python-based optimization framework designed to tackle energy and material flow problems using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP).

It bridges the gap between **high-level energy systems models** like [FINE](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE) used for design and (multi-period) investment decisions and **low-level dispatch optimization tools** used for operation decisions.
