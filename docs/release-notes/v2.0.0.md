### Model Structure & Performance

- **Modeling Improvements**: Better handling of fixed flow rates and consecutive hours constraints
- **System Connectivity**: Added flag in FlowSystem to prevent multiple iterations of connecting the system
- **Label Management**: Improved how labels are constructed and handled throughout the system
- **Variable Naming**: Made variable names more compact by making Model Labels optional
- **Results Access**: New methods to quickly access flow and storage results

## üìö Documentation

- **Google Style Docstrings**: Updated all docstrings to Google style format
- **Mathematical Documentation**: Improved mathematical documentation with better MathJax rendering
- **Example Improvements**: Enhanced documentation examples and fixed inconsistencies
- **API Documentation**: Reorganized API documentation for better clarity
- **New Navigation Layout**: Improved documentation navigation structure

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Storage Model**: Fixed issues in storage modeling and charge state handling
- **Linear Segments**: Resolved bugs in linear segment implementation
- **OnOff Model**: Fixed handling of previous values and consecutive hours constraints
- **TimeSeries Handling**: Multiple fixes for TimeSeries data management
- **Excess Flow**: Added excess to inputs and outputs of Bus components

## üîÑ Dependencies

- **Updated Linopy**: Updated dependency to use the latest version
- **Solver Interfaces**: Improved handling of different solver interfaces

## üìã Migration Notes

- Several internal classes and methods have been renamed for consistency
- The way labels are constructed has changed throughout the system
- If you were directly accessing the internal model structure, you may need to update your code
