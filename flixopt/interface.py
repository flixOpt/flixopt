class Piece(Interface):
    """Define a linear segment within a piecewise linear function.

    This class represents a single linear segment that forms part of a larger
    piecewise linear relationship. Each Piece defines the domain boundaries
    (start and end points) for one segment of the function, enabling the
    modeling of complex non-linear relationships through linear approximations.

    Args:
        start: Values marking the beginning of this linear segment.
            These define the lower bound of the domain where this piece is active.
        end: Values marking the end of this linear segment.
            These define the upper bound of the domain where this piece is active.

    Examples:
        Creating a piece for an efficiency curve segment:

        ```python
        # Represents efficiency from 40% to 80% load
        efficiency_piece = Piece(start=40, end=80)
        ```

        Multiple pieces forming a complete piecewise function:

        ```python
        # Low efficiency at part load (0-50% load)
        low_load_piece = Piece(start=0, end=50)

        # High efficiency at full load (50-100% load)
        full_load_piece = Piece(start=50, end=100)
        ```

        Time-varying piece boundaries:

        ```python
        # Operating range that changes with time)
        time_dependent_piece = Piece(
            start=np.array([10, 20, 30, 25]),  # Minimum capacity by timestep
            end=np.array([80, 100, 90, 70]),  # Maximum capacity by timestep
        )
        ```

    Note:
        Pieces typically "touch" at their boundaries (end of one piece = start of next)
        to ensure continuity in the piecewise function. Gaps between pieces can be
        used to model forbidden operating regions.
        Overlapping Pieces effectively leave the decision on which piece is active open.

class Piecewise(Interface):
    """Define a piecewise linear function composed of `Pieces`.

    This class creates complex non-linear relationships by combining multiple
    Piece objects into a single piecewise linear function. Each piece represents
    a different linear segment that applies over a specific domain range,
    allowing accurate approximation of curved relationships through linear
    interpolation between breakpoints.

    Args:
        pieces: List of Piece objects defining the linear segments of the function.
            Pieces should typically be ordered by their domain (start values) and
            may overlap at boundaries to ensure continuity. Gaps between pieces
            can represent forbidden operating regions.

class InvestParameters(Interface):
    """Define comprehensive investment decision parameters for optimization models.

    This class encapsulates all parameters needed to model investment decisions
    in optimization problems, including sizing constraints, cost structures,
    and operational flexibility. It supports multiple cost modeling approaches
    from simple linear relationships to complex piecewise functions, enabling
    accurate representation of real-world investment economics.

    Investment modeling capabilities include:
    - Fixed vs. continuous sizing decisions
    - Multiple cost components (fixed, variable, piecewise)
    - Optional investments with divestment penalties
    - Technology learning curves and economies of scale
    - Multi-period investment planning with proper annualization

    Args:
        fixed_size: When specified, constrains the investment to exactly this size,
            creating a binary invest/don't-invest decision. When None, allows
            continuous sizing between minimum_size and maximum_size bounds.
        minimum_size: Minimum investment size for continuous sizing decisions.
            Defaults to CONFIG.modeling.EPSILON to avoid numerical issues.
            Ignored when fixed_size is specified.
        maximum_size: Maximum investment size for continuous sizing decisions.
            Defaults to CONFIG.modeling.BIG to represent unlimited capacity.
            Ignored when fixed_size is specified.
        optional: Controls investment optionality. When True (default), the
            optimization can choose not to invest. When False, forces investment
            to occur, useful for mandatory infrastructure or replacement decisions.
        fix_effects: Fixed costs incurred once if the investment is made, regardless
            of the investment size. Typical examples include permitting costs,
            connection fees, or base equipment costs. Dictionary mapping effect
            names to scalar values (e.g., {'cost': 10000, 'CO2': 500}).
            **Important**: Costs must be annualized to the optimization time period.
        specific_effects: Variable costs proportional to investment size, representing
            per-unit costs like â‚¬/kW_nominal or â‚¬/mÂ²_nominal. Dictionary mapping
            effect names to unit cost values (e.g., {'cost': 1200, 'CO2': 0.5}).
            **Important**: Costs must be annualized to the optimization time period.
        piecewise_effects: Complex non-linear cost relationships using PiecewiseEffects,
            enabling modeling of bulk discounts, technology learning curves, or
            economies of scale. Can be combined with fix_effects and specific_effects.
            **Important**: Costs must be annualized to the optimization time period.
        divest_effects: Costs incurred if the investment is NOT made, such as
            demolition costs for existing equipment, contractual penalties, or
            opportunity costs. Dictionary mapping effect names to scalar values.

    Note:
        **Cost Annualization**: All cost values must be properly annualized to match
        the optimization model's time period. For example, if modeling annual decisions
        but equipment has a 20-year lifetime, divide capital costs by 20 or use
        appropriate discount rates to convert to equivalent annual costs.

    Examples:
        Simple binary investment (solar panels):

        ```python
        solar_investment = InvestParameters(
            fixed_size=100,  # 100 kW system (binary decision)
            optional=True,

                'CO2': -50000,  # Avoided emissions over lifetime
            },
            specific_effects={
                'cost': 1200,  # â‚¬1200/kW for panels (annualized)
                'CO2': -800,  # kg CO2 avoided per kW annually

    This class models equipment that operates in discrete on/off states rather than
    continuous operation, capturing the operational constraints and economic impacts
    of binary decisions. It addresses real-world equipment behavior including
    minimum run times, startup costs, cycling limitations, and maintenance schedules.

    Common applications include:
    - Power plants with minimum load requirements and startup costs
    - Industrial equipment with batch processes or discrete operating modes
    - HVAC systems with thermostat control and equipment cycling
    - Process equipment with startup/shutdown sequences
    - Backup generators and emergency systems
    - Maintenance scheduling and equipment availability

    Args:
        effects_per_switch_on: Costs or impacts incurred for each transition from
            off state (var_on=0) to on state (var_on=1). Represents startup costs,
            wear and tear, or other switching impacts. Dictionary mapping effect
            names to values (e.g., {'cost': 500, 'maintenance_hours': 2}).
        effects_per_running_hour: Ongoing costs or impacts while equipment operates
            in the on state. Includes fuel costs, labor, consumables, or emissions.
            Dictionary mapping effect names to hourly values (e.g., {'fuel_cost': 45}).
        on_hours_total_min: Minimum total operating hours across the entire time horizon.
            Ensures equipment meets minimum utilization requirements or contractual
            obligations (e.g., power purchase agreements, maintenance schedules).
        on_hours_total_max: Maximum total operating hours across the entire time horizon.
            Limits equipment usage due to maintenance schedules, fuel availability,
            environmental permits, or equipment lifetime constraints.
        consecutive_on_hours_min: Minimum continuous operating duration once started.
            Models minimum run times due to thermal constraints, process stability,
            or efficiency considerations. Can be time-varying to reflect different
            constraints across the planning horizon.
        consecutive_on_hours_max: Maximum continuous operating duration in one campaign.
            Models mandatory maintenance intervals, process batch sizes, or
            equipment thermal limits requiring periodic shutdowns.
        consecutive_off_hours_min: Minimum continuous shutdown duration between operations.
            Models cooling periods, maintenance requirements, or process constraints
            that prevent immediate restart after shutdown.
        consecutive_off_hours_max: Maximum continuous shutdown duration before mandatory
            restart. Models equipment preservation, process stability, or contractual
            requirements for minimum activity levels.
        switch_on_total_max: Maximum number of startup operations across the time horizon.
            Limits equipment cycling to reduce wear, maintenance costs, or comply
            with operational constraints (e.g., grid stability requirements).
        force_switch_on: When True, creates switch-on variables even without explicit
            switch_on_total_max constraint. Useful for tracking or reporting startup
            events without enforcing limits.

    Note:
        **Time Series Boundary Handling**: The final time period constraints for
        consecutive_on_hours_min/max and consecutive_off_hours_min/max are not
        enforced, allowing the optimization to end with ongoing campaigns that
        may be shorter than the specified minimums or longer than maximums.
