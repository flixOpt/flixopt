"""Superseded tests — replaced by tests/test_math/.

These tests have been replaced by more thorough, analytically verified tests
in tests/test_math/. They are kept temporarily for reference and will be
deleted once confidence in the new test suite is established.

All tests in this folder are skipped via pytestmark.
